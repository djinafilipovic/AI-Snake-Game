# AI Snake Game

This project implements a Snake game where the snake is controlled by a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for training and decision-making. The game uses reinforcement learning, allowing the AI to learn and improve its performance over time.

## Features
- Snake game using Pygame
- Reinforcement learning using Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment with epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
- Real-time training with plotting of performance metrics
